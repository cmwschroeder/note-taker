# Note Taker

## Description

This is a web app that you can use as a note taker. Just fill in your note with a title and some text in the note and click the save button that will appear once both fields have something in them. This will add your note onto the list on the left. From there you can click on any of the notes on your list on the left. This will open up a read only version of the note that you can read.
